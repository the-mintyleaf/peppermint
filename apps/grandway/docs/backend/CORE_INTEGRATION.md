# Integration — Grandway Backend

**Owner app:** `core`
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-07-21
**Purpose:** The entry point for anyone — human or AI — integrating a client against this backend from outside the repository. Read this file first, then the per-app `INTEGRATION.md` for each app you consume.

## Change History

| Version | Date | Author | Summary |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0.0 | 2026-07-21 | AI (Claude Opus 4.8) | Initial project-level integration entry point |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-07-22 | AI (Claude Opus 4.8) | `authenticate` app shipped: real token-issuance (login/refresh) now exists — removed the stale "not callable" warning; added `authenticate` to the inventory and dependency graph |

> Two things still require out-of-band setup, and neither is resolvable from the client side:
> 1. **Base URL** — no host is published in this doc; obtain it from whoever runs the backend.

## 1. What this backend is

A Django + Django REST Framework JSON API. There is no server-rendered HTML surface other than Django admin at `/admin/`, and no GraphQL. Every client integration goes through the versioned REST API described here.

This repository is **backend-only**. It does not contain, and will not contain, frontend code. Its obligation to a consuming project is this documentation set.

## 2. Reading order for a consumer

1. **This file** — global conventions, auth, the app inventory, and the cross-app dependency graph.
2. **`<app>/docs/INTEGRATION.md`** for each app you consume — the endpoint-by-endpoint contract, including what each endpoint requires to function and what it changes.
3. **`core/policy_engine/docs/openapi.json`** — machine-readable paths, methods, permission keys, and risk levels, if you are generating a client.

Do **not** read app source, `API.md`, or `DATA_CONTRACT.md` to integrate. `API.md` and `DATA_CONTRACT.md` are maintainer-facing (they document database tables and internal rationale). The `INTEGRATION.md` files are the consumer contract.

## 3. Global conventions

Every app follows these unless its own `INTEGRATION.md` §3 explicitly states a deviation.

**Base path.** All endpoints are under `/api/v1/`. Breaking changes ship under a new prefix (`/api/v2/`); additive changes do not. A deprecated endpoint returns a `Deprecation: <date>` response header before removal.

**Success envelope.** The resource is always under `data`, never at the top level. `message` may be an empty string. `meta` is always present, `{}` when there is nothing to report.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Policy applications retrieved.",
  "data": { "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", "key": "policy_engine" },
  "meta": {}
}
```

**Error envelope.** `error.details` is **always present** — an empty object `{}` when there are no field-level errors, and a map of field name to an array of messages when there are. Stack traces are never returned.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input.",
    "details": { "permission_key": ["Must be lowercase 'app.model.action'."] }
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

**Error codes.** `APP_RESOURCE_REASON` in upper snake case (e.g. `LISTINGS_LISTING_NOT_FOUND`). Codes are stable — treat them as part of the contract. Global codes: `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` (401), `PERMISSION_DENIED` (403), `NOT_FOUND` (404), `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400), `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500).

**Pagination.** Page-number based. `?page=` and `?page_size=` (default 20, max 100).

**`data` is the bare array of results — it is NOT nested under a `results` key.** Page metadata lives in `meta`, never alongside the rows. `next`/`previous` are absolute URLs including scheme and host, or `null`.

A full `GET /api/v1/policy/apps/` response with every field populated:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Policy applications retrieved.",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "key": "policy_engine",
      "display_name": "Core Policy Engine",
      "description": "Registry of every endpoint, permission key, and dependency edge.",
      "current_version": "1.0.0",
      "is_active": true,
      "is_deprecated": false,
      "created_at": "2026-07-21T06:15:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-07-21T06:15:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "count": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 20,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null
  }
}
```

An unpaginated list endpoint returns the same bare array in `data` with `meta: {}`. Not every list endpoint paginates — each app's §3 states which do.

**Worked failure responses.** A 403 from a non-staff caller, and a 404 for an unknown key:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "PERMISSION_DENIED", "message": "Staff access required.", "details": {} }, "meta": {} }
```

```json
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Not found.", "details": {} }, "meta": {} }
```

**IDs.** Public identifiers are UUID strings. Auto-increment integer keys are never exposed. Some resources are addressed by a stable slug or key instead of a UUID; the owning app's §7 says which.

**Times.** ISO 8601, UTC. Timestamps are timezone-aware.

**Money.** Decimal, serialized as a string to avoid float precision loss. Never parse as a native float.

## 4. Authentication

JWT via SimpleJWT, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

**Token issuance lives in the `authenticate` app** (`/api/v1/auth/`). `POST /api/v1/auth/login/`
(username + password + `device_id`) returns an access token; `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh/` rotates it.
See `authenticate/docs/INTEGRATION.md` for the full contract. Access tokens are **session-bound**:
the server re-validates the underlying session on every request, so blocking, logout, and password
change revoke access immediately regardless of token lifetime.

- Access token lifetime: 15 minutes (24 hours in development).
- Refresh credential: opaque, server-stored, rotated on use, with reuse detection (7-day absolute /
  12-hour idle lifetime). In production it is a `Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite` cookie; in development it
  is returned in the login/refresh response body.

**Getting a token today.** Create the initial superadmin with
`python backend/manage.py bootstrap_superadmin --username <name>`, then `POST /api/v1/auth/login/`.

**Authorization today.** `authenticate`'s own protected endpoints (`logout`, `me`, `password/change`)
are authenticated self-service (any signed-in user, acting on their own account). `core.policy_engine`
still uses the interim check: authenticated **and** `is_staff`. There is no role- or permission-key-based
enforcement in the request path yet — the Core Policy Engine *describes* the permission surface but does
not yet gate requests with it (`CLAUDE.md` §9).

Every endpoint denies by default. Any public endpoint is explicitly marked as such in its app's `INTEGRATION.md`.

**Health checks** are the exception — `GET /health/` (liveness) and `GET /ready/` (readiness, includes DB connectivity) require no auth and are excluded from rate limiting.

## 5. Rate limiting

Project defaults: 100 requests/hour for anonymous callers, 1000/hour for authenticated ones. Exceeding them returns 429. Limits are not currently surfaced in response headers — treat 429 as the signal and back off.

## 6. App inventory

| App | Base path | Purpose | Contract |
|-----|-----------|---------|----------|
| `authenticate` | `/api/v1/auth/` | Platform identity: username/password login (+ TOTP MFA), session-bound JWT, revocable device sessions (max 3), forced first-login password change, and admin account + session management (one-tier hierarchy: superadmin manages admins, admin manages lead managers) | `authenticate/docs/INTEGRATION.md` |
| `audit` | `/api/v1/audit/` | Central, immutable, cross-app activity/change history. Read-only over HTTP (Admin/Superadmin); populated by other apps via an internal service call | `audit/docs/INTEGRATION.md` |
| `core.policy_engine` | `/api/v1/policy/` | Read-only registry of every endpoint in this backend: permission keys, risk levels, dependency edges, version history, change log | `core/policy_engine/docs/INTEGRATION.md` |

**Routes outside `/api/v1/`.** `core` exposes three, and they are deliberately outside the registry-completeness guarantee in §9 (which covers `/api/v1/` only). They have no permission key and are not client API surface:

| Route | Auth | For consumers |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `GET /health/` | none | Liveness probe. Returns 200 while the process is up. Safe to poll; excluded from rate limiting. |
| `GET /ready/` | none | Readiness probe, includes DB connectivity. Returns 200 only when able to serve. Safe to poll; excluded from rate limiting. |
| `/admin/` | session login | Django's built-in admin UI for internal staff. **Not an API** — no JSON contract, no stable surface. Never integrate against it. |

## 7. Cross-app dependency graph

Assembled from each app's `INTEGRATION.md` §2 `Requires`. Use it to determine integration order: an app's dependencies must be usable before it is.

- `authenticate` → `core` (framework), `django-axes` (framework), `rest_framework_simplejwt` (framework), `argon2-cffi` (framework), `django-otp` (framework — TOTP MFA), `audit` (service call — emits auth events to the central audit log, best-effort)
- `audit` → `core` (framework), `authenticate` (framework — supplies the request user for the `is_staff` read gate)
- `core.policy_engine` → `core` (framework), `authenticate.User` (FK — the platform user model, since `AUTH_USER_MODEL = authenticate.User`), `rest_framework_simplejwt` (framework)

No app-to-app runtime coupling exists yet. When it does, each edge appears in **both** apps' §2 sections — the depended-on app records what would break, the depending app records why it needs it.

## 8. Machine-readable artifacts

Generated from the endpoint registry, committed, and CI-checked for drift — they cannot silently fall out of sync with the code.

| Artifact | Path | Authoritative for |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Registry export | `core/policy_engine/docs/registry_export.json` | Every registered endpoint: permission key, app/model, route, method, operation type, risk level, version, category, dependency edges |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | `core/policy_engine/docs/openapi.json` | Paths, methods, `operationId` (= permission key), `x-permission-key`, `x-risk-level`, bearer security, envelope components |
| Registry schema | `core/policy_engine/docs/registry_schema.json` | The JSON Schema for one registry entry |

**Limitation — read this before generating a client.** The OpenAPI document is authoritative for *paths, methods, permission keys, and risk*, but its request/response **body** schemas are generic: every operation returns the envelope with an opaque `data`. Field-level shapes live in each app's `INTEGRATION.md` §4 `Models`. A generated client will therefore have correct routes and auth but untyped payloads; type the payloads from §4.

## 9. Guarantees and non-guarantees

**Guaranteed.** Every routed `/api/v1/` endpoint is registered in the policy registry and appears in the artifacts above — CI rejects an endpoint that is not (`validate_policy_engine` rule 14). Every registered endpoint is documented in its app's `INTEGRATION.md` — CI rejects one that is not (`validate_integration_docs`). So the endpoint *inventory* is provably complete.

**Not guaranteed.** Prose field descriptions inside a documented endpoint are not mechanically verified against the serializer. If a payload field seems wrong, the code is authoritative and the doc is a bug — report it.

## 10. Gaps

- Request/response body schemas are not machine-readable (see §8).
- Permission-key-based authorization is not yet enforced in the request path (see §4); `authenticate`'s own protected endpoints are authenticated self-service, and `core.policy_engine` uses `is_staff`.
- **No host is published here.** Every path in this documentation set is relative to a base URL you must obtain from the deploying team (locally, `http://localhost:8000`). There is no public sandbox environment.
- **The first account requires shell access.** Token issuance exists (`authenticate`), but the initial superadmin is created by the `bootstrap_superadmin` management command, and there is no self-service signup — so the very first credential must be provisioned server-side (§4).
- Rate-limit state is not exposed in response headers — 429 is the only signal (§5).
